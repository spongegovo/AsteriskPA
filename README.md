# AsteriskPA

I'm saving this so it can be used by others that might need this requirement.

## What does it do?

This reference files are design to help you be able to make Asterisk PABX provide a PA annoucement output with a ALSA sound card with some extra features:
 - Music loop through, with cut out when the PA is activated
 - Pre and Random post annoucements. Grab the attention of the crowd and then in my use case, a funny post Annoucement
 - You will also be able to hear the annoucements play back from the phone that is making the annoucement
 
Once configured, dial your configured number in the extensions.conf file and away you go.
